# Overview
SCXMLIDL is the first step towards standardization of [SCXML][1] interpreter APIs. SCXMLIDL covers a small subset of API that can be mapped to different current SCXML interpreter implementations. It lets you generate code for the targeted interpreter implementation by generating code from a given webIDL. 

Currently  SCXMLIDL supports code for [Commons SCXML][2], [uSCXML][3] and [LXSC][4]
